# We structured things so that if a reload is needed because of a
# configuration file change, it occurs before the start issued below.
# Also note that the reload action for Chef's service resource does nothing
# if the service is not started, which is fine since the start action
# below will occur after anyways (loading the new config in the process).

# For the purposes of cross-checking the implementation and behavior of
# the Chef service resource, I believe amazon and centos use the default
# provider: Chef::Provider::Service::Init.
